The factor package
=================

The [factor package][] is a [Haskell][] library for factoring integers
and polynomials, implementing the following algorithms:

- [Number field sieve][] for factoring arbitrary integers
- [Elliptic curve method][] for finding "small" factors of integers
- Miller-Rabin probabilistic primality test
- Berlekamp-Zassenhaus algorithm for factoring integer polynomials
- Berlekamp algorithm for factoring polynomials over GF(p), for a small prime p
- Cantorâ€“Zassenhaus algorithm for factoring polynomials over GF(p), for an arbitrary odd prime p

This software is released under the [MIT License][].

Install
-------

Installing the factor package requires [cabal][]:

    git clone https://github.com/gilith/factor.git
    cd factor
    cabal install --enable-tests

The factor package contains an executable called `factor`, which is
[run][factor usage] as follows:

    Usage: factor [options] "expression to factor"
          --trial=N       Set trial division maximum to N
          --ecm-primes=N  Limit ECM to first N primes (use - for no limit)
          --nfs-chars=N   Use N quadratic characters in NFS
          --nfs-verbose   Show complete lists in NFS verbose messages
      -v  --verbose       Enable verbose messages
      -t  --timestamp     Prepend verbose messages with timestamp
          --version       Print version
      -h  --help          Show help

Example input expressions:

      2047               Concrete integer
      2^2^7 + 1          Integer expression
      N[100]             Random 100-bit positive integer
      P[50] * P[50]      Product of random 50-bit primes
      x^4 - 10*x^2 + 1   Polynomial over the integers
      x^5^2 - x (mod 5)  Polynomial over GF(5)

Let expressions are supported: `let p = P[4] in x^p - x (mod p)`
Multivariate polynomials (e.g., `y^2 - x^3 - a*x - b`) are not supported

Test and Profile
----------------

Use [cabal][] to run the test suite:

    cabal test

Profiles of the time and memory requirements for factoring inputs of
various sizes:

- [Number field sieve profile][]
- [Elliptic curve method profile][]

The following recipe can be used to [visualize the dynamic memory
usage][Number field sieve memory] of the number field sieve:

    cabal clean
    cabal configure --enable-profiling
    cabal build
    factor +RTS -hc -RTS -v --ecm-primes 0 'P[40] * P[40]'
    hp2ps -e8in -c factor.hp
    gm convert -density 180 factor.ps factor.png
